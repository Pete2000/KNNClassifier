# KNNClassifier
A simple KNN document Classifier.
To try this project you need to put a text in the "test.txt" file and the KNN will try to classify it in one of the categories of the dataset. (It will tell what the text is about).\\
The dataset I used is a list of classified news documents from http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/.

Compile:
g++ -std=c++17 knn.cc -o exe
